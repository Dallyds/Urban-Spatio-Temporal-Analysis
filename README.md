🚦 Urban Spatio-Temporal Traffic Analysis
📌 Project Overview

This project presents a spatio-temporal analysis of urban mobility and traffic patterns using trip-level, environmental, and congestion-related data. The goal is to understand how time, location, traffic conditions, weather, and land use influence travel behavior and congestion in urban environments.

The analysis is implemented using Power BI, providing interactive dashboards for effective decision-making and insights.

🎯 Project Objectives

Analyze trip demand and usage trends over time

Examine distance, speed, and travel efficiency

Study the impact of traffic, weather, and land use on congestion

Identify high-congestion zones and peak travel periods

Compare current vs predicted future congestion levels

📊 Dashboard Pages

The Power BI report consists of the following dashboards:

Trip Demand and Usage

Trip volume trends

Passenger distribution
