# Urban Spatio-Temporal Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes urban transportation data to understand travel patterns across time and space. 
The analysis focuses on trip demand, distance, speed, congestion, traffic flow, weather conditions, 
and land use to derive actionable insights for urban mobility planning.

## 🗂 Dataset
The dataset is provided in Excel format and includes trip-level attributes such as:
- Trip date and time
- Distance and travel duration
- Passenger count
- Traffic speed and congestion levels
- Weather and environmental conditions
- Land use and location coordinates

📁 Dataset file: `data/urban_trip_data.xlsx`

## 📊 Power BI Dashboard
An interactive Power BI dashboard was developed to visualize:
- Trip demand and usage trends
- Distance and speed analysis
- Revenue and environmental impact
- Traffic conditions and location-based insights

📁 Power BI file: `powerbi/Urban_Spatio_Temporal_Analysis.pbix`

## 🖼 Dashboard Screenshots
Since Power BI files cannot be viewed directly on GitHub, dashboard screenshots are provided for preview.

📁 Location: `dashboards/screenshots/`

## 🛠 Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel
- Power BI
- Data Visualization Techniques

## 🎯 Key Insights
- Identified peak travel hours and high-demand days
- Analyzed congestion levels across different land-use types
- Evaluated the impact of traffic and weather on travel speed
- Observed spatial travel behavior using geographic data
