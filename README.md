## 🚦 Urban Spatio-Temporal Traffic Analysis
<br>**📌 Project Overview**

This project presents a spatio-temporal analysis of urban mobility and traffic patterns using trip-level, environmental, and congestion-related data. The goal is to understand how time, location, traffic conditions, weather, and land use influence travel behavior and congestion in urban environments.

The analysis is implemented using Power BI, providing interactive dashboards for effective decision-making and insights.

**🎯 Project Objectives**

Analyze trip demand and usage trends over time

Examine distance, speed, and travel efficiency

Study the impact of traffic, weather, and land use on congestion

Identify high-congestion zones and peak travel periods

Compare current vs predicted future congestion levels

**📊 Dashboard Pages**

**The Power BI report consists of the following dashboards:**

**1)Trip Demand and Usage**

Trip volume trends

Passenger distribution

Travel time patterns

**2)Distance and Speed**

Trip distance analysis

Average speed vs congestion

Road type performance

**3)Revenue and Environmental Impact**

Fare amount analysis

Distance vs revenue trends

Traffic impact indicators

**4)Traffic and Location**

Start and end location mapping

Congestion hotspots

Vehicle count analysis

**5)Summary Dashboard**

 ##Key KPIs

Integrated insights across all dimensions
